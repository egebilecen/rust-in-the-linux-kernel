# Rust in the Linux Kernel - Project Source Code
This repository contains code and other scripts used in the [research paper](https://ege.r0m.cc/shared/Rust_in_the_Linux_Kernel_Research_Paper.pdf) that evaluates the Rust in the Linux kernel.

## Folders
`c`: Contains code for loadable kernel module written in C.

`rust`: Contains code for loadable kernel module written in Rust.

`python`: Contains scripts to test loadable kernel modules and some parsers to parse the output of `objdump` and `readelf`.
